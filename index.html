   <ul>
     <li> 1 1/4 Cups Unsalted Butter (put in microwave for 10 seconds) </li>
     <li> 1 cup White Sugar </li>
     <li> 1 cup Dark Brown Sugar </li>
     <li> 2 Large Eggs (cold) </li>
     <li> 1/3 cup Cocoa Powder </li>
     <li> 2 cups All Purpose Flour </li>
     <li> 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons Cake Flour </li>
     <li> 1 teaspoon Baking Powder </li>
     <li> 1/2 teaspoon Salt </li>
     <li> 3.5 cups Dark or Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips </li>
   </ul>
   <h3 class="steps">Steps </h3>
    <ol>

      <li> Place one rack in middle of oven. Preheat the oven to 400 convection bake or 425 regular bake. Let the oven preheat for 20 minutes before baking. </li>
      <li> Cut butter in tablespoon size pieces and place into a stand mixer. Turn the mixer onto medium speed and beat the butter and sugars for a minute until the butter starts to mix with the sugar. </li>
      <li> Add eggs one at a time until mixed well. (Keep speeed on medium) Turn mixer off and add the cocoa powder mix until its all blended well. Scrap sides of bowl a few times while mixing. </li>
      <li> Fold in chocolate chips. Turn mixer down to low or use a spoon until the chocolate is mixed equally. </li>
      <li> Scoop the cookies onto a kitchen scale, they should weigh about 6oz each. There will be roughly 8-9 cookies after weighing them. If you want smaller cookies weigh until about 3 oz. Refrigerate before baking to keep the dough from spreading too much. </li>
      <li> The big cookies do not need to be cooled only the smaller ones. Put 4-5 big cookies on a baking sheet at a time. </li>
      <li> Bake for 5-7 minutes, you will know they're done when a crust has formed on the top and they don't look wet. </li>
      <li> If they spread too much you could use a spatula and push the edges into a circle. </li>

    </ol>
